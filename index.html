								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> My individual website: https://sm-akash.github.io </p>
								<p> My name is S M Akash, 20 years old, I am from Bangladesh which is very small and densely populated country. I came Australia to do my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in RMIT (s3669349). I am not from any IT background. So I don’t know much about IT. But I learnt a lot of it after doing assignment 1 of this course. I want to learn new skills this is why I chose this one as my elective. I like boxing, roadtrips, soccer as my hobby. I also have interest in cars, bikes I mean in automotive sectors. And I believe, hard work can beat talent. So working hard everyday to develop myself. </p>
								<p> The ideal job I am looking for in IT industry is IT Desk Analyst. There are few reasons that make this position appealing to me. Like I would be able to provide 1st level support and customer service, able to maintain centralized repository of documentation and process, able to diagnose reported problem etc. Besides others requirements I can easily learn. Most importantly, I can get 80% of the required skills by completing this course. The job requires excellent communication Skills, 1-2 years experience in same role, and experience Wintel, Windows, Windows desktop, Active directory, PC & phone hardware, Microsoft office etc. Regular participation in different event has improved my communication skills. I have also good skills in microsoft office works and gadget hardware. And I think being a communicative guy will help me to be updated with this IT industry. From my group, pretty much everyone is looking for same IT related job but in different part. Like someone wants to work as analyst, someone into designing, someone wants to work as operation manager, and someone has interest in cyber security etc. These position maybe differentiates us from each other. </p>
								<p> I have taken three different online test and they are Myers-Briggs test, online learning-style test, Five-personality test result. The result of Myers-Briggs test is ESTJ (Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging). ESTJ personality represents “The Executive”. ESTJs are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding what is right, wrong and socially acceptable. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with ESTJ personality are valued for their clear advice and guidance. ESTJs are also good as organizer, working hard to bring people together. The result of online learning-style test describes me as a Visual Learner. That means I like kinesthetic learning and auditory learning. I like everything to do properly and in time. Five-personality test result: Neuroticism was moderate at 58%, Openness was moderate 58%, Conscientiousness was high 71%, Extraversion was moderate 48%, Agreeableness was moderate 62.5% By giving all these tests, now we know each-other very well, we know where to improve. However, this is just a result, but working as a group is different and beneficial. As a group member I have the opportunity to learn different skills from other members. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> My individual website: https://s3698291.github.io/ </p>
								<p> My name is Edmund Tan, currently 18 years old and “Life is short so go big, so wild and eat” is the wisest philosophy I ever thought of in my entire life. My hobbies are playing badminton and card games with my friends.  I came from Malaysia to study Bachelor of Technology in RMIT and this is my student number, s3698291. Firstly, I have to say that I don’t have much IT experience, I can only do the basics on a laptop, phones and I just learnt how to use github from the previous assignment. As for my interest in IT, I would say that I’m interested In learning cloud computing and robotics because they are both interesting and have potential to contribute to the society. </p>
								<p> The ideal job that i look forward to have is being a web designer as i like web coding and expressing my creativity. This job has flexible working hours because it allows me to work anywhere as long as i have a laptop and internet connection. Other than that, it requires good teamwork and communication skill. This is because I need to know what the client wants and fulfill the requirements, good teamwork is needed so that when working in groups, it is possible to complete the task as efficient as possible without any arguments. This way, the productive level of the group will increase and the workload of each other can be shared and solved together. As a web designer it also requires me to be creative and open minded to ideas. This is because I need to design a website that is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and user friendly. All of the members have ideal jobs that are in the IT industry.Our ideal jobs may be in the same industry but the position of our jobs are different. Jason’s ideal job is to be a java software engineer, Akash’s ideal job is to be an IT desk analyst, Oliver’s ideal job is to be a security lead or something related to cybersecurity, and Jamarl’s job is to be an IT operation manager. Based on that, it can be seen that, jason’s ideal job is similar to mine but it is much more related to coding and only uses java. Oliver’s ideal job to related to cybersecurity which prevents hackers from breaching the system. Jamarl’s ideal job is related to leading and managing a group of people. Akash’s ideal job is to analyse and identify the potential problems. They may be different jobs with different goals and requirements but the common things that all five jobs have is that, it requires good teamwork skill, communication skill, and creativity. Without those three skills, it is difficult to be a good employee. </p>
								<p> After completing three online tests, I received results on my personality, learning style, and creativity. I think that these results may have a positive influence on my behavior on the team. It can be observed from the Myers-Briggs test that I am more extroverted, which means I can communicate easily and effectively in a team. Other than that, the second test shows that I am a tactile learner. This shows that I learn things by touching and doing, this will increase the interaction between me and the team which leads to an increase in teamwork. On the last test it states that got 68/100 in the creativity test, which means I am open to creativity and will not reject or restrict any innovative solutions even if that solution is a solution that no one has tried and I am a problem solver. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> My individual website: https://jtchandra.github.io/s3730387.github.io/ </p>
								<p> My name is Jason Theodore, 18 years old and I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. I came to Australia to take Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT and my student number is s3730387. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, badminton, and reading novels. Coming from a different culture, I grew up as an introverted person in Indonesia. However since coming to Australia, I began to slowly step out of my comfort zone to meet new people. I do not have any proper IT experience before and I am eager to learn new skills. My interest in IT is programming and security in computing and IT. Programming always seemed as an interesting activity before I even got the chance to properly study it and I don't intend to stop learning and finding more ways to improve. Although I have not started learning security in computing and IT, it seems to be an important aspect that stands out in the IT industry. Since there have been an increase in cyberattacks around the world, the job prospect would definitely seem more valuable and it gives a chance for people to help society. </p>
								<p> The ideal job that I look forward to is being a Java software engineer since I am interested in programming using Java. It requires teamwork and communication skills which are crucial to fulfill the requirements for this job. For the ideal job that I chose, it indicates that I should be open minded regarding the fact that it is essential to be able to work with the group of co workers to be assigned with. This shows that the skills required are not too different from other ideal jobs from my group member because despite having different working fields, communication and teamwork skills are just as important. Aside from that, I must have in-depth knowledge of programming using Java. SQL programming is a requirement as well to do different types of softwares, despite it being used for database. Creating and maintaining business relationships is another required skill because it is very important especially when working with clients. Troubleshooting, maintenance and customer service are other important aspects although these are generally not prioritised as much. Problem solving is a very important aspect to have for programmers because the field of work relies on that particular skill. Without having good problem solving skills, it would be extremely difficult to improve. Since everyone would be working in teams, planning is also important because without a proper plan, creating large projects will be hectic. If the plan is not clear as well. Lastly, being very observant to details is an important and necessary skill because if not, it would be difficult to find faults in written codes. It may be different compared to my group members ideal jobs since some require candidates to have experience in more than one particular field. For example, being a web designer may require the candidate to do well in HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc whilst for my ideal job it only requires me to do well in Java. Some other aspects that may differentiate from other ideal jobs could be the environment in which we work in. For example, for Akash’s ideal job, it requires him to deal with hardware and manufacturing process while for my ideal job, there are far less equipment that are required for me to use. A common element among all the ideal jobs would be having a design cycle that helps to prepare and build the products for each respective field. It includes proper research to give a clear view of how the product should be made and what needs to be done. Regardless of the field of work, all of the ideal jobs would require to create a design plan prior to creating the final product. </p>
								<p> I completed three different online tests to assess my personality by using Myer-Briggs, Big Five Personality Test and Learning Style Test. From the first test, Myer-Briggs, it concluded that my personality fits a “The Mediator”, in which the description says that these are idealistic people who will always attempt to focus at the positive sides of people, including those whom show terrible attitudes or during worse events. This allows me to better handle unwanted situations such as arguments or miscommunication among group members. It also allows me to see through a different perspective when dealing with these conflicts and provide the opportunity to help my team to respect one another. The following test, Big Five Personality Test implies that I am ambiverted although I lean mostly towards being introverted. I can work with a small group rather than working with a large group. Being introverted can also be a disadvantage because I may not always be too comfortable to say my thoughts out loud to my group members. However to overcome that I would need time to get adjusted working to my team. Aside from that, the test shows that I would have no issue regarding teamwork, thus making it easier to communicate with one another. The last test that evaluates learning styles shows that I am a visual learner. It means that my preferred way to learn is through sight. Watching how my group members work will be the best option for me to learn more about their preferences of doing their work. However this does not mean that I will communicate less with them, instead it should give me the initiative to inquire more about how my teammates work if I do not understand it. Being a visual learner can contribute a lot to the group work, especially when the report will be represented through a website. </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> My individual website: https://s3650536.github.io/ </p>
								<p> My name is Jamarl Sarry, student number 3650536, born and raised in Wewak, a small town north of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a very culturally diverse country, we have the people form the islands, the coastal region of the mainland and the people of the Highlands. Fun fact, I am a very adventurous person, who is always up for road trips, camping and travelling to different places and experiencing different cultures. Favourite sport growing up includes football and rugby but as I grew older I lost interests in football and got more involved in rugby. I am mostly interested in Programming, security in computing, cloud computing and Web development. I think IT is a very broad program, there is more to it than we know, we live in a technological age, where everything around us is changing to digital that is why my interest in IT occured because i want to be part of that change and contribute to a better technological future </p>
								<p> This will have a significant effect on my daily life as the changes above will affect not just me but everyone as well. It is because I will most likely require the service provided by the industries above. As mentioned above that artificial intelligence will make our daily life easier. Using self-driving cars as an example, it can help reduce my risk of getting in a car accident because the artificial intelligence will be driving, and it is proven that computers make lesser mistakes than humans. Other than that self-driving vehicles in public transport will also benefit me if I am taking public transport to places. This is because it is time efficient as less mistakes will be made. Other than that, artificial intelligence will also provide me with better healthcare. Compared to traditional doctors that are more susceptible to mistakes, artificial intelligence can give me a better and more accurate diagnosis of my body if I am sick. Just like all things, artificial intelligence also has disadvantages to it. Because it can do things that human can’t do and also do a better job which will result in more efficient, more effective, and more productive workers. This will lead to business owners who only care about profit to sack all human laborers as it is not efficient and help the business earn lesser profit. It might millions and millions of people including me to lose their job. </p>
								<p> Myers-Briggs test states that my personality type is “The Consul,” which means, people that are popular and very outgoing, always open to have a discussion, always spotted at a party having a good time with friends. The Online learning style test indicates that I am an Auditory/Visual learner. Which means I may learn things by listening and reading or seeing pictures. I can easily store and remember information by the way it sounds and I can understand and remember things that I see, by visualising it in my head. The online test I chose was Big Five Personality Test, the result I got sates that I was labelled as Extroversion, which means I am positive emotionally and I am an outgoing social person. These results indicate that when working in a team, I will get along with all my team members, because I am an outgoing person who likes to converse and interact with people, I will be the life of the team, someone who is very social and has a positive attitude which brings up the team spirit whenever the members are feeling down or just not into it. To be honest, when forming a team, I would not take these results under consideration. I believe everyone is unique in their own way, hence we all should work together despite our differences and that is what defines teamwork, different people coming together to produce something outstanding. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> My individual website: https://oliver5297.github.io/Introduction-to-Information-Technology/ </p>
								<p> Hi! My name is Oliver Le, my student ID number is: S3745987. As my surname suggested, I am Vietnamese and I love my Vietnamese foods, especially Pho. I love to play computer games as part of my everyday enjoyments and listen rap music. I am particularly interest in cybersecurity and hoping that one day I can design my own cybersecurity system that would provide safer and much more convenient to use. I am a new to the IT world! But I have basic computer skills like everyone else.  </p>
								<p> My ideal job is to become Security lead or something related to cybersecurity. I am really interested in this area because I believed that we are living in the fast-moving, advance technologies world, where our personal information is vulnerable to threats. I have seen many scams over the phone and the internet over a few years, this made me realize that how vulnerable our personal information is, and that we are easily and willingly to pay huge amount of money to the scammers, especially, old people. Therefore, I hope that I able to develop an easy cybersecurity software for any electronic devices or works as an intelligence Analyst, where I review the available information and determine the threats’ next action. This job highly demands different teams working together along with excellent communications and well-planned actions between each team members in order to prevent threats harming people. Base on every team members’ given information, I can see that we all interest in different areas of specialization of Information Technology world, not just one area. Akash wants to become an IT Desk Analyst and Jamarl wants to become a IT operation manager. To me, these two jobs are in very similar field of IT industry, where Akash would have to report any cases and ask for help from Jamarl, as an IT operation manager if Akash comes across any difficult cases. Edmund and Jason’s jobs both heavily rely on creativity. Edmund as a web designer requires him to constantly come up with new designs for each website or base on customers’ references. While, Jason is constantly under the pressure to create and code new programs that would be helpful and useful to the public. Therefore, even though each member in this team has different interest in various area of the IT industry, but we all hope that we can get our dream job and be able to be involved in the IT industries. </p>
								<p> According to Myers-Briggs test, I am a Logistician. A logistician is someone whose works base on logics, integrity, dedication and taking responsibility to work towards a particular goal, while, following the given rules and standards. Therefore, I think my personality would help when working in the team environment as I like to ensure and keeping track of the team’s progresses and making sure that we will ultimately achieve the goal at the end. The Big Five test results demonstrate that I am easily get worry about a project or able to meet and achieved the end goal. To me, there are advantages and disadvantages to this personality as I am easily get stress whenever something is not done, therefore, this could affect the teamwork and behaviours across Special 1s. The last test from: “How to Study” indicates that I am both a visual, auditory and words learner. This is where I need to actively repeat the information and draws out any relevant researches to the topic. Additionally, when I learn, I also need to construct diagrams and make relevant connections between new information and known information in order to encode the new information into my brain. Overall, there are many different personality tests available on this earth, I confidently believe that as long as each of the team members respect each others and understand that we all want to achieve the ultimate goal at our best, then we all should work hard and achieve the goal even though there are massive differences across all of the team members.  </p>

								<h2 class="major">Industry Data</h2>
								<p> 1. What are the Job Titles for your group’s ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?  </p>
								<p> Every member has different group ideal jobs, starting from Edmund whose ideal job is to be a web designer, Akash who wishes to be an IT desk analyst, Jason who wants to be a Java software engineer, Jamarl who would want to be an IT operation manager, and Oliver who wants to be a lead security.  Both Jamarl’s and Oliver’s ideal job did not appear on the list and there wasn’t a similar job title, so their ideal job’s rank cannot be determined.  After looking at the burning glass data, Akash’s ideal job placed first with a vote of 555, following by Jason’s ideal job with a vote of 539. Edmund’s ideal placed last among the three with a vote of 381. </p>
								<p> 2a. How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</p>
								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> There are many parts of IT. It depends on which part I want to work. There are heaps of Information Technology skills like analytical skills, business related skills, computer related skills, Data science skills, developer skills, hardware skills, Microsoft skills, network skills etc. As I had interest for IT desk analyst job I need to have a good idea over analytical skill, Microsoft skill, communication skill, troubleshooting skills, system backup skills, ITIL skills etc. Besides a IT desk analyst also train employees in software and business related issues. However, this is not the best job in the industry, but it requires a good idea over IT skills. But the experience period needed in this job is only two year. Currently I am studying on IT and skills are still growing, have a good idea in some parts. And I am trying to develop myself every moment. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> From the data obtained from the burning glass, it can be seen two of my IT-specific skill was in the top ten. With JavaScript placing second with a vote of 2946, it show the importance and the demands of the skill. Because it is a requirement, I must learn more and be efficient at it as well so that I have a higher chance of getting my ideal job. As a web designer, graphic design is not a requirement but a bonus and will increase chances of getting the job. However, graphic design placed tenth with a vote of 2068, showing that the demand for it is relatively high as well. Even if I don’t get my ideal job, I can get similar jobs as the IT skills are quite high in demand.  Unfortunately, skills that are essential such as website production and python did not place that high. Website production was placed seventeenth with a vote of 1366 and python was the third last from the list with a vote of 1150. The skills may not be high in demand, but it is still better to learn the skills as python can still be used in other programming related jobs. Unlike python, website production is solely focused for jobs that makes websites. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> SQL is ranked first in the chart and this shows how important and demand it attracts, even if my ideal job prioritizes Java. Having it as a requirement also means that I have to learn more regarding SQL programming as it can increase my overall skills for my ideal job. Not only that but it can increase my chances of getting into other similar jobs if I fail to get accepted for my ideal job. Java is the third highest ranked skill; however, it should be prioritized more than SQL to meet demands for my ideal job. Being very skilled in Java is much more important than having adequate skills in SQL considering the requirements for my job. Despite SQL having more demand, being skilled in both will attract just as much demand and make it easier for me to receive the ideal job I look for. Building relationships is ranked eighth in the chart and it is understandable that it is not ranked as high. Working clients and building good relationships with them leaves a good impression and it makes it easier in the future when working with the same clients. The following skill is technical support and as mentioned in my ideal job’s requirements, maintenance is a necessity and it is very helpful for users because they do not care much about technical skills and if they are struggling to use the developed softwares, I can guide them to find a solution. Customer service is another skill that is similar to technical support, however this would be guiding users with more general issues while technical support is more specific. It shouldn’t be as prioritized as much as the rest because for my ideal job, it wouldn’t be too important.  </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> Currently my IT specialized skills are still growing; however, I do have a fair understanding in some aspects of IT such as java, C++, computer systems and Microsoft office. My ideal job requires me to have a high knowledge in not only IT but also in project management, because as an IT Operations Manager, being in charge of what takes place in the IT department is my priority, I am required to have specialized skills in planning, organizing, team management, project management, building relationships, server infrastructure analysis, programming and networking. Hence this job is very diverse, and it requires knowledge from different areas from Computer Science to Management. Burning Glass data in specialized skills in greatest demand in the field of IT states that programming skills such as Java, SQL and JavaScript are the top three most demanding from employers. Other Skills includes Project Management ranked fifth, Business Management ranked seventh, Business Analysis ranked ninth and Microsoft Office ranked eighteenth. Overall IT Operations Manager is a very high ranked job that requires years of experience and a broad range of knowledge from different principles in Management, Business and IT, which is why I think it is an ideal job for me because it does not stick to one area of work, and it is role that is very demanding for employers, because good leadership and management skills results in excellent productivity of work. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> According to Burning Glass Data, the required IT skills set in the cybersecurity world is not very demanding. Knowledge of security networks such as ITIL ranked in twentieth place on the list. While, most of the required skills in cybersecurity is not listed on the data. This demonstrates that cyber-security is not the most demanding job currently out there. Surprisingly, both customer services and technical support ranked higher than ITIL. This could be because due to excellent customer services and technical support would help to attract much more customers, hence, companies increase profit. Even though, this skill is not essential in a position of cyber-security leader, but it is still better to have good customer services as it is expected for a cyber-security leader to handle difficult situation that other team members cannot handle. </p>
								<p> 2b. How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </p>
								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> We all know teamwork makes the dreamwork. Most of the time in a team all we need to do is communicating with each other properly. So that we can share our work, contribute our work, discuss different stuffs. An IT desk analyst always need to communicate each other in order to complete his work. Not only in this job, nowadays every job requires good communication skill. In burning glass data, it is also ranked as number one. As a analyst need to provide advanced troubleshooting, perform system backup and recovery and configure/assemble peripheral equipment. So, it is important to be a problem solver. In my team, I always maintain a good communication with each other and from my previous studies I think I am good solver as well. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> As a web designer it is important to have this few general skills, communication, creativity, time management and teamwork/collaboration, as it will be useful when working. Out of the four, only three skills are in the top ten in the burning glass data. At first place with a vote of 44367, communication is the most demanded skill from employers. It is also the most important skill, not just for my ideal job but for every job. This is because without communication work can’t be done effectively. Using web designer as an example, communication allows me to know how the client wants the website to look like and it also helps me build relationships. Teamwork/collaboration is also quite high in demand with it being the fifth in the burning glass data with a vote of 14364. Teamwork/collaboration will also help build relationship, it enables me to work in a team without difficulties. This will allow the productivity and efficiency of the team to increase. Placing ninth on the burning glass data with 7475 votes, creativity is a relatively high in demand skill. This is because creativity will help with problem solving and critical thinking. On the other hand, time management might not be in the top ten but its is still quite a popular skill sought after by employers as it is ranked twelfth with a vote of 5059. Time management is somewhat similar to communication where is also important for other jobs. Good time management shows that the individual is responsible which will help increase the chances of getting employed and the trust between employer and employee. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> The highest ranked skill shown in the graph is communication skill in which I had mentioned that it is just as important for any job. When comparing the results, communication skills has a large gap over other skills and this emphasizes how important and valuable communication is. Having poor communication skills will make every task more difficult than it already is. The second highest skill is problem solving and it should be valued the same as communication skills because for programmers or software engineers, without the skill there would be no significant progress being made. One of the main purposes of creating software is to provide solutions to client’s issues and that is the fundamental ideology of problem solving itself. Teamwork is the third skill mentioned in my requirements and in the chart, it is ranked fifth. I agree that teamwork is not as important as the other two skills mentioned previously because at the end, individual skills should be prioritized more and that helps people to stand out more. Without communication and problem-solving skills, teamwork will be ineffective hence it somewhat relies on both skills in order to succeed. Troubleshooting is ranked 6th in the chart and it is important for keeping the system working because if errors arise, having these skills will ease the tasks. Planning is the following skill and it is ranked seventh. I believe planning should be perceived to be as important as teamwork. Planning can potentially change the outcome of a project, whether it can be better or worse. If group members can always stick to the plan and complete the tasks as expected from the plan, the project can go smoothly but I am aware this may not always be the case, which is why planning should not be prioritized above the other skills mentioned. </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> The general skills required for my ideal jobs are good communication which is ranked number one on the Burning Glass skills in greatest demand; I have to have good communication skills over my team member, being in charge what requires confidence and the information exchanged between my team and myself has to be clear so that we may not have any misinterpreted information circulating, which leads to even bigger problems occurring. Secondly is problem solving  skills, this is a skill highly required skill set, it is ranked second, it is compulsory for everyone in the workforce to have excellent problem solving skills, because in reality there will always be problems occurring in the workforce, for an IT Operations Manager, this skill is essential, because there will always be a problem occurring in Systems Hardware and Software,  error in data, security issues, bugging issues and  whenever faced with problems like that it is necessary to approach it accordingly in order to solve it. Thirdly is Teamwork, it is a must to have good team work qualities, because I will be working with people from different areas and backgrounds and for everything to run smoothly I must get along with everyone. Other skills involve planning ranked seventh, leadership qualities which is something I know I have ranking eleventh, Meeting Deadlines ranked sixteenth, Analytical skills, Management and lastly Decision Making. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> The most demanding skill across all the jobs such as IT Operation manager, automotive or program engineer, cyber-security lead, etc. is communication skill. Communication skill is considered to be an essential skill as they play a major role in a team environment in order to drive towards a particular goal every day. This data is supported by data from the Burning Glass Technologies, where communication skills have the highest-ranking requirements form employers. The second required skill is across most of our employers are problem solving or ability to respond to changes. This is an essential skill, especially, when working in a team environment. For example, as an IT operation manager, the manager is required to have ability to identify and investigate the problems in order to produce efficient and effective solution in response to the incident. Similarly, to a cyber security lead, they role requires the leader or analyst have ability to identify the problems trigger by threats and find most easy and effective solution. </p>
								<p> 2c. What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?  </p>
								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> Like Jamarl, I also do not need Structured Query Language and Java in my ideal job. But as I have interest in Information Technology I also have interest to know about these things. All I need for my ideal job are provide advanced troubleshooting, train employees in software and hardware, relevant business knowledge, configure/assemble equipment. And all these things are not related to three highest ranking skills based on burning glass data. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> For my ideal job, it is not required to know Structured Query Language (SQL) even though it is the most demanded skill. I did not include Java that is the third most demanded in my required skill set because web designers seldom use java and it is more suited for java developers or programmers. Microsoft windows is the fourth most demanded skill, but I did not put it under my required skill set because I have been using it for a long time Even though, I did not use all of the features, but I know the basics and it is sufficient for a web designer. The skills mentioned above may not be in my required skill set because it is based on my current ideal job, it might change depending on the ideal job that I have in mind. Those skills are much more suited for IT jobs that are related to developers and programmers. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> JavaScript is the second most demanded skill and I did not put it in my required skill set because that skill is related to web design, while it isn’t related to Java. In the requirements for my ideal job, JavaScript isn’t in the requirements either. I believe that learning JavaScript will not give any benefits for working as a Java software engineer, as instead it will hinder my progress of improving my skills in using Java. Microsoft Windows is the fourth most demanded skill and I did not put it into my required skill set because since I have been using it for so long, I did not think that it would be an important skill. However, I am sure there are still a lot of aspects I have yet to cover. The last skill is project management and I did not think about it because from how I perceive that skill, it suits more towards leaders who are willing to take responsibility and lead the team to complete their projects. My introverted personality does not fit that description of a leader; hence I think that project management isn’t what I require for my ideal job. </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> Structured Query Language (SQL) and JavaScript are not required in my ideal job; however, I do need to know about Java. To be an IT Operations Manager it does not necessarily requires me to be specialized in one area of skills. Even though, the two top programming languages from Burning Glass data are not a requirement for my ideal job, I will still be working with people that require that skills such as software engineers, programmers and data analysts. Therefore, I will somewhat come across this skill working as an IT Operations Manager. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> As Jason mentioned before, the three highest ranking skills based on Burning Glass data is SQL, JavaScript and Java. These skills are not very essential in a cyber-security lead analyst. This is because these skills are programming base, which is suitable for those who interest in develop a program or programming. These data also further indicate that programming is a very popular field in the Information Technology world. From a cyber-security position, the most important and essential skill is able to analyze huge amount of given data and able to find an effective resolution to solve the problem. </p>
								<p> 2d. What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </p>
								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> Top three skills in Burning glass data: Writing, teamwork and troubleshooting. All these skills are required for my ideal job. It is not only required for my job, it is required for any job. In an IT company, I will have to deal with different people, I will have many works to do so these three skills will help me to do so. Most important is, these three skills will make someone eligible for any job. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> Problem solving skill is the second most demanded skill, but I did not include in my required skill set because it is somewhat an “inferior” version of creativity skill. With creativity skills, I can come up with innovative and creative solutions for my problems. There are problems in all jobs, but some requires imagination to solve them. For example, web designers. Problem solving is much more suited for jobs that have problems which have a fixed answer and not much imagination. I also did not include the third most demanded skill, Organizational skill, into my list of required skill set because I believe that it will not be much help for my ideal job. It is much more suited for jobs such as database developers where they have to organize and sort the data. The fourth most demanded skill, writing, also did not make it into my list because web designers don’t have to write much codes nor essay. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> Organizational skill is the third most demanded skill in the chart and I did not include it in the skill set list because before viewing the data, I believed that it is more suitable towards jobs related to business or requires organizing data such as database developers or database administrators. Writing is the following most demanded skill according to the data and I believe that writing is not too important for my ideal job because it does not mention that having to write reports is a massive requirement or aspect of the job. However, it is understandable that it has a high demand because having excellent writing skills will be helpful during situations like creating printed manuals that act as guidance for users who are not familiar with using new computer systems, software, electronic devices, etc. Creativity is the last skill and I did not include it because I believe that above all other skills, problem solving will be the most important one thus it removed the necessity for other skills such as creativity. However, it does depend on the projects that are being worked on as I now realize creativity may be important for some aspects. </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> All the three highest ranked general skills are required by my employer for my ideal job. As an IT Operations Manager, it is highly required for me to have excellent communication, problem solving and organization skills. As mentioned my ideal job does not only require one area of specialty, I have to work with different people from different areas of specialty in the Information Technology industry and my skills has to be very broad in order to be the perfect candidate for the job. Therefore, I am required to at least have 90% of all the general skills listed by Burning Glass Technologies. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> The top three general skills which are listed in Burning Glass Data, are all required for my career. The next three ranking skills are: writing, teamwork and troubleshooting respectively. To my understanding, writing skill is somewhat an important skill to have in the cybersecurity industry as it requires you to write a report after a case is solved or updating new evidence. Ability to use and express the cybersecurity language is very important as you want to make sure that when other team members read the case, they understand what happened, what is the plan and what have been done. Teamwork is very important in order to combat external threats. This is because a cybersecurity analyst would require analyzing a huge amount of incoming information, therefore, this is not an easy job for a person to be able to analyze all by themselves and able to come with the best solution that would overcome the problems effectively and efficiency. Lastly, troubleshooting skill is not very essential in the cybersecurity analyst industry as this job requires a lot of analyzing information and come with a resolution but not really require ability to troubleshoot computer programs or errors in programs. </p>
								<p> 3. Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</p>
								<h1> Akash </h1>
								<p> After having a look in burning glass data, my opinion for ideal job has not been changed. Because this is what I want to do, this is what I want to be. Besides requirement for this job is not very high. I can easily meet the requirement. Most importantly, two years of experience will make me more eligible for this job. I am also very interested in this role. I want to work where I have my passion. </p>
								<h1> Edmund </h1>
								<p> After comparing ideal jobs with my group mates and going through the burning glass data for Job titles, IT-specific skill, and general skill I’ve decided that I will not change my ideal job. First of all, web designer is my passion and they offer reasonable amount of pay with fairly flexible work hours. My ideal job may rank lower than my group mate, but I still believe that the demand for it will increase as the technology advances, more and more things will be related to IT and require websites. Furthermore, the required skill set for web designer are overall fairly high in demand. So, if I wanted to change my ideal job, there won’t be much difficulty. Lastly, the general skills that are required in web designers ae also quite high in demand from employers. This will mean that changing jobs will be fairly easy for me. </p>
								<h1> Jason </h1>
								<p> No, it has not changed my thoughts regarding the ideal job I chose because the skills I listed, both general and IT specific, were listed as some of the highest demanded by employers. Instead of hindering my motivation to receive the ideal job, I believe that it instead provides a stronger incentive to pursue my ideal job for my future career. I have to put my mindset into honing the required skill set to meet the standards and if I can do that, it will be easier to achieve my goal of receiving the ideal job I look for. Although the data of the top occupation shows my ideal job has the highest number of positions being hired, it somewhat makes me more anxious because I know that it means I will face a lot of competition from other candidates applying for the same job. The gap between software engineer and computer systems engineer / architect is quite a lot and that is why I am rather concerned it might be difficult to land a job. However, it also means that compared to other jobs, I will be provided with a lot of options to choose from due to the high demand. Hence it gives both an advantage and disadvantage, although it still leans in more towards having more advantage. My perception on my ideal job remains the same, as I expected it to have high demand because in the future, businesses will rely more on technology and majority of users will also expect improvements in current softwares. I believe that it will become more challenging as time goes on, however that does not disinterest me. The ideal job I have consists of using general and IT specific skills that are mostly demanded and thus it may give the opportunity to find other similar jobs that use these skills, in case I ever change my mind regarding my ideal job. </p>
								<h1> Jamarl </h1>
								<p> My ideal job will not change, I believe that this job is perfect for me and it is what I want to accomplish in my career, I may have to work my way up as it requires years of experience and it may take a bit of time to get there but I will certainly make it because I am determine, I may be required to have to study a bit on Business and Management in IT  which I am also very interested in and makes this job more ideal for me, it  does not have to only be about Information Technology, it is more than that, it develops a person to work with different people that are specialized in different areas of Information Technology which is both interesting and challenging, but I am passionate in learning new things and having a wide range of skill sets and that is why this is my ideal job. </p>
								<h1> Oliver </h1>
								<p> After looking at the given data provided by Burning Glass, I decided that I would not change my ideal job. This is because, I believe that all of our ideal job comes from each of our passions and interest in specific areas that attract us to the job. Furthermore, I also believe that nothing else such as money or have high employment rate still matters if you get to work in your particular interest job, which would motivate us to continue following our passion. </p>

							<article id="technologies">
								<h2 class="major">IT Technologies</h2>
								<p> After some discussion, it is decided that our group will be discussing the following four topics. Artificial Intellignece, Cyber Security, Clouds, Servers, and Services, and Autonomous Vehicles.</p>
								
								<h1> Artificial Intelligence </h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/AI.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Artificial Intelligence, AI, is also known as machine intelligence. It is intelligence demonstrated by machine. As technology progresses, technology is slowly taking over the world especially Artificial Intelligence because it is able to learn how human performs and do a better job. Artificial Intelligence has been used in many industries such as financial services, healthcare, travelling, etc. In other words, it is used in almost all of the industries and it is affecting the lives of regular people from moment to moment.  In 2018, Artificial Intelligence is used for basic and complicated task. Basic task such as toys and games, transportation, education, etc. Complicated task such as finance, media, hospital and medicine, etc. Let’s say that Artificial Intelligence have been further developed for another 3 years, I think that Artificial Intelligence will be everywhere. It will be a whole new experience where humans will rely on Artificial Intelligence heavily on everything. Task that usually take a few humans few days to complete will take an Artificial Intelligence a few minute or seconds to complete. Because Artificial Intelligence is used to in many industries, it is hard to determine which technological or other development is required to make it happen. To make it simple, only IT related developments will be discussed. For this to happen, advanced programming is required so that it can function properly without any faults. Other than that robotics is required because Artificial Intelligence will also be implemented in robots as well as other electronics such as mobile phones, fridge, tv, etc.  Although recognition technology such as face, and voice recognition are already developed, it still isn’t that advanced yet. Therefore, it should be further developed to a point that it can easily recognize the owner without any mistake. Lastly, as technology advances, the potential harms grow as well. Because of that a better cyber defense to prevent any hackers and system breaches. </p>
								<p> In the next 3 years, transportation industry is most likely to change by artificial intelligent machines. Currently, there are already companies such as Uber and Lyft and other research centers already working on self-driving cars service.  The proposed plans for the future are that public transports such as train and buses will be fully operated by intelligent machines. The cost for each trip would be equal to the current cost of a single trip to by current public transport services. Furthermore, automatic transport services would help to save time, stress ease, commuting through peak hours and also reduce road accidents. Secondly, medical field would also be greatly impact by artificial intelligent machines. The propose outcome is that artificial intelligent robots and machines would provide much better and accurate diagnosis compare to humans. Base on accurate diagnosis, machines can therefore, provide much more effective and efficient to patients. Lastly, as humans try to improve artificial intelligent machines.  This would lead an increase in the Information Technology would increase as companies specializing in artificial intelligence are constantly for potential employees who have ideas how to improve this new area. However, there are also many disadvantages to artificial intelligent machines. Human jobs would decrease a lot, lead to an increase in unemployment. As jobs can be done by machines much faster and a lot more accurate, companies would rather spend money and buy these artificial intelligent machines to increase their rate of production and cheaper labor, hence, would bring much more profit to the company. Companies that heavily rely on artificial intelligence machine for their products-making process would have to spend large amount of cost to fix, repair and maintenance these complex machines of they decide not to function properly.  These costs could require up to millions to repair and hundreds of thousands to regular check-up and maintenance each month. </p>
								<p> This will have a significant effect on my daily life as the changes above will affect not just me but everyone as well. It is because I will most likely require the service provided by the industries above. As mentioned above that artificial intelligence will make our daily life easier. Using self-driving cars as an example, it can help reduce my risk of getting in a car accident because the artificial intelligence will be driving, and it is proven that computers make lesser mistakes than humans. Other that that self-driving vehicles in public transport will also benefit me if I am taking public transport to places. This is because it is time efficient as less mistakes will be made. Other than that, artificial intelligence will also provide me with better healthcare. Compared to traditional doctors that are more susceptible to mistakes, artificial intelligence can give me a better and more accurate diagnosis of my body if I am sick. Just like all things, artificial intelligence also has disadvantages to it. Because it can do things that human can’t do and also do a better job which will result in more efficient, more effective, and more productive workers. This will lead to business owners who only care about profit to sack all human laborers as it is not efficient and help the business earn lesser profit. It might millions and millions of people including me to lose their job. </p>
								
								<h1> Cyber Security </h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cybersecurity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Cybersecurity acts as protection for computer systems that includes hardware, software, or perhaps the data stored in these systems and networks from unauthorized access. Cybersecurity is generally considered to be a crucial practice that is normally implemented in businesses due to the increasing amount of cyber attacks in recent history. In order to work properly, it usually implements several methods to protect users’ data from attacks. The most basic types of cybersecurity can take in the forms of creating strong passwords, avoiding scams received from emails or phone calls, to using security applications to protect computers from malware, viruses, etc. Cybersecurity is extremely important in use of large businesses and governments as well. Getting access to data records of users can be seen as valuable for cyber criminals. As society progresses, so does technology and our reliance on using technology. As reported from the BBC, a government survey shows 46% of all british firms had experienced at least one cyber attack in the year 2017. It shows that it still requires major amounts of improvement to prevent future attacks. </p>
								<p> Encryption of data is arguably the most important aspect of cybersecurity to protect data and prevent risks. It encodes data that should allow only authorised users to access. For example in a business firm, only authorised employees such as managers, or higher positioned staff can have access. IT firms use encryption software that emphasizes on cryptography to encrypt stored data. Another option is cyber-physical system that is a mechanism controlled by computer algorithms to view activities from the internet and its users. It is made up of a network consisting of physical devices that links with computational elements that can be found in field of works like healthcare, banking, etc. Without emphasis on cybersecurity, the damage sustained can be dangerous. An infamous ransomware known as WannaCry targeted an estimated amount of 200,000 computers spread among 150 countries. The hackers responsible exploited issues in older Windows operating systems and legacy systems were especially easier to target. Cybersecurity was not a priority towards older systems before this ransomware began and because of that, massive amounts of organizations lost massive amounts of funds. Although the ransomware lasted for 4 days, current practices and methods used in the cybersecurity industry was not strong enough to recover the lost data. </p>
								<p> There are a few technologies and developments that helps cybersecurity to develop and improve in the future. The first technology is hardware authentication, a system that relies only on hardware to give access to users. There are few hardware components being used, such as USB security keys, biometric verification, etc. Some organizations may prefer using USBs because it is very portable and these are small devices. Users must connect the USB to the computer’s port as part of the procedure. Users must always remember the system password and always be in possession of the USB key. This makes it rather difficult for hackers to get access because without having the USB, it is practically impossible. The other component, biometric verification uses a more complex system because the computer system gives access by identifying users through biological aspects. There are different types of identifiers such as fingerprints, voice recognition, iris patterns, etc. Using only biometric verifications to login into the system is extremely effective because it limits the options and possibilities for black hats to attempt logging in and giving themselves access. However since it is very expensive to implement, majority of organizations may not have the necessary funding required to use these security systems. In the future when improvements have been made and prices of components decrease, biometric verifications should be more accessible to more organizations. Using complex security systems can ensure protection for businesses and the sensitive data being contained. The most effective way to increase cybersecurity standards is not to focus on just one security system, but rather improve other systems to let organizations have different methods to protect their data. If black hats can figure out a solution to exploit a security system, organizations can use different systems as backup. Hence, focusing only one security system will jeopardize not just the organization being targeted, but rather other organizations and the cybersecurity industry as a whole. </p>
								<p> According to the Royal Society, it states that current progress isn’t adequate for IT firms to defend against cyberattacks. If the government does not make a proper change to this system, it will eventually become extremely costly to the economy. The development of this field of work still has a lot of potential to grow. The demand will inevitably increase because more IT firms will require people with these certain skills to help create a positive impact. Cybersecurity may become a popular choice for the future generation because of its importance and contribution to society. When compared to other fields of work, cybersecurity does not have the potential harm to replace redundant jobs with AI because very skilled people are responsible in creating new types of cyber attacks to target people. To counter the issue, IT firms will require more people to conduct research towards new methods and practices to be implemented, while increasing their current standards of all cybersecurity firms. </p>
								<p> The target group that will mostly be affected would be businesses and its clients because they are the main priority for both cyberterrorists and cybersecurity firms. Businesses will be taught new practices and standards for keeping their data safe, while cyber terrorists will strategize more complex and creative ways to steal data from them. The outcome depends on both parties and as of right now, while cybersecurity firms will bear more responsibility due to the increasing amount of cyberattacks. For example, Huazhu Hotels Group, considered to be one of the largest hotel groups operating in China, had started investigating a case where millions of data containing its customers records were leaked. Such breaches can be very costly not just to the business involved, but also to the customers related to these cases. Cyberterrorists that hold access to personal data of customers can use plenty of ways to blackmail them. Cyber attacks are unpredictable and difficult to trace back to its culprits hence why in the future it may be potentially more dangerous and difficult to prevent, especially towards users who do not have adequate technical skills. </p>
								<p> Cybersecurity is just as important for every user to ensure our personal data is saved. If cybersecurity is not implemented in our daily activities, cyber terrorists can attempt to exploit us through any vulnerable aspects that they can find. The most famous cases come in the form of scams. Being unaware of different types of scams can be extremely dangerous as we are leaving ourselves exposed to potential criminals who can steal our personal information such as bank details. Being well aware of how cybersecurity works and familiar with the practices can avoid massive problems like these not only for ourselves, but also to educate friends and family regarding such scams. If cybersecurity standards continue to improve, it would be less worrying because that means there would be a lower possibility of experiencing a scam received online. Using the internet is a part of my daily life and because of that, I need to ensure myself that I should be wary of potential scams. For example, it may be common for others to receive emails that seem legitimate, only to find out it is a part of a scam. </p>
								<p> Having an antivirus software is another important tool because it prevents users from receiving malware, spyware or any other type of computer virus. Without the existence of these softwares, it will leave majority of users very vulnerable to threats. As technology progresses it tends to become more complex as well and if users are not always updated about it, they may be left behind in terms of information. This is especially worrying for older family members because they may not always understand newer technology and that leaves them to be more vulnerable. This does not only apply to older people, but users as well who are not that familiar with these practices or have sufficient knowledge regarding these scams or viruses.  </p>
						
								<h1> Clouds, Servers and Services </h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cloudindustry.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Cloud computing is a service that enables, efficient on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources through the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing. Cloud computing provides essential, flexible and low-cost IT resources. Cloud computing it sort of an outsource platform, therefore users may not worry about managing the hardware. Users are provided with resources, they need, instantly and only pay when is use. </p>
								<p> Software as a service(SAAS)  enables users to access application software’s independently of the platform on an on demand pay-per use basis without even installing the software in their computer, cloud operates a single software, which will be accessible for multiple users on the network which is efficient and cheap. The vendor will manage and be responsible for all computing resources, leaving users with less worrying about upgrade or any other software issues. The service will be accessible to users via the web browsers or an application platform provided by the vendor. 	The intended users for this service are end users of softwares. There are few service providers such as, Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, HR Helpdesk, etc. SAAS is accessible from any platform that has access to the internet. This enable multiple tenancy and is very useful for collaborative working. Other than that, some vendors offers simple and reliable software tools. However, there will be transportability and bowser issues because the performance of the internet may have an influence on the accessibility of it. So, if there is no internet connection, user will not be able to use it. Furthermore, SAAS might have some restrictions on some aspects of the service. </p>
								<p> Platform as a service (PASS) is another service, but it  provides a platform to enable users, mainly developers to build and manage their applications and services. This platform is composed of programming language execution environment, an operating system, web server and a database. It delivers a setting that allow users, mainly programmers and software developers to build, compile and run their work without any inconvenience. Users only concern is to manage the data and application source. All other resources are handled and managed by the vendor. Overall the PAAS is an environment for software developers. The intended users for this service are programmers and developers. Some examples of service providers are Amazon Web Service, Google App Engine, Windows Azure, etc. PAAS might be cost efficient but it only offers limited amount of languages and tools. Other than that, it helps developers promote their software and make the development easier by exposing it to the market. </p>
								<p> Design and structure are provided by infrastructure as a service (IAAS) It delivers all computing resources such as data storage, virtualization, servers and networking in a virtual environment therefore many users will be able to gain access and use of this service. Users will only be responsible operating resources such as applications, data, runtime and middleware. The intended users for this service are system admins. Amazon Ec2, Go Grid, Rackspace.com are examples of service provider for IAAS. IAAS is very flexible, it might due to the infrastructure being provided by cloud which. It also helps improve in scalability. However, the network and service will experience some delay if the internet connection is bad or there is a cloud upgrade. </p>
								
								<h1> Autonomous Vehicles </h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/autonomous.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> An autonomous vehicle is capable of sensing its environmental and navigating without human input. An autonomous car is also known as driverless car, robot car, self-driving car. 29 states in USA allows autonomous vehicles. There are several systems that work in conjunction with each other to control a driverless car. Radar sensors dotted around the car monitor the position of vehicles nearby. Lidar sensors help to detect the edges of roads and identify lane markings. Autonomous vehicles developing its technologies each year though in 1961 it was first made. Within next 3 years it will go to another new level. Maybe people will be dependent in autonomous vehicles. There are some technology behind it like radar, GPS, odometry, computer vision, advanced control system etc make this possible. </p>
								<p> Autonomous vehicles are expected to drive on our roads in the near future. This column reviews research into the effects this will have on the economy and on society. New business models for truck operators and delivery companies, commuters putting the time they would have been driving to more productive use, and fewer accidents and greater efficiency on the road are among the developments that will benefit the economy. At the same time, driverless cars will become a major means of transport for elderly people in rural areas, while in urban areas the number of cars owned for personal use will drop sharply. And these autonomous vehicles going to replace regular vehicles. </p>
								<p> There will be few changes in daily life when these autonomous vehicles will be on the road. Like vehicles designs will be changed, Software/Technology companies will own more of the world’s economy, most vehicles will be electric that means fuel station will be empty, driver’s license will slowly go away, traffic police will become more redundant, traffic lights and signs will become obsolete. If these things happen then pretty much everything will be changed in someone’s daily life. Disable people will be able to use these autonomous vehicles, roads will be safer, accident percentage will reduce. It will also be great for those people who don’t want to drive, like my family member and some of my friends. </p>

						<!-- Project Ideas -->
							<article id="ideas">
								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/projectidea.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Our project idea is an application that provides service on finding nearby online tutors that are available to meet up with the user. The aims of the app is to allow users, mainly students, have their questions answered right away or an assignment that they need help with. While, for the tutors, this service would help them to improve their teaching skills, yet earn money at the same time. The process is similar to other services such as Uber, where the application first detects the location of users to locate nearby tutors around that area or the users can choose a specific tutor such as a math tutor or a science tutor for their tailor specific needs.  </p>
								<p> Tutoring is not easily accessible to every student and as a group, we believe it can fill in the market gap through our project idea. In 2017, research reported that one in three of all Australian university students had failed to complete courses. This is especially worrying because instead of improving, students are performing worse after graduating high school. Through the use of the tutoring app, it can be very beneficial for students who are struggling to cope with the school system. Access to tutoring may be expensive for some students, and because of that the application would not charge such high fees for students. The idea should be fulfilled through working together with established tutors because if we decide to randomly choose tutors it would simply harm the chances of success. </p>
								<p> Users will have the option to choose the study level, that is between high school and university. They should specify which subjects they are attempting to study and they aren’t allowed to choose more than one subject. After choosing a subject, they are allowed to choose more than one topic they would like to study. Users cannot choose more than three topics because having too many topics to study at the same time will not be effective. Users can save these options which will be added to a list titled “Saved Topics”. The application will have a chatting system implemented that will allow both tutors and users to communicate before the meetings or after the meetings. Furthermore, the application allows both users to book a tutor at specific dates and time if they would like to continue with the tutors. Assigned tutors can review the topics that the student has chose, making it easier for both parties when they meet up. Tutors can come prepared and it would be recommended for users to book with tutors they enjoy studying with. An organisation tool would also be added into the app. This tool aims to remind the users what tasks need to be done before meeting up with the tutors, hence, making  the meet up more efficient and learning experiences are much more effectively.  </p>
								<p> Additionally, this tool also acts as a reminder, where they notify both users and tutors about the meeting one hour before or to a specific set time by both parties. To make it easier and consume less time, both parties can check each other’s current location. Google Maps will be implemented because it is the best mapping service and users friendly as other applications such as Zomato, Uber, etc, all use Google Maps. Furthermore, the users would able to choose a specific study location where they would like to meet up with the tutor such as their home or a cafe shop. The application is multi-platform, implemented on both iOS and Android systems because by having users from both platforms it would have a better chance in succeeding. There will be more potential consumers and limiting to just one platform may not guarantee that it will be successful on the chosen platform. Furthermore, an online website that provide information about the tutors and their qualifications  to the users before the users decide whether they want continue to book this tutor or they are happily to be spontaneously pair up with a different tutor. </p>
								<p> Rating and review system is a necessity for the application because it is the most effective method to evaluate whether the tutors are meeting the standards set up for them. Users can give honest their opinions and thoughts regarding the experience they had with their tutor. The rating aspect will be based on a minimum score of 1 point and maximum score of 5 points. The points will be displayed as stars where the user can select number of stars based on their experience. After rating the tutors, users have the option to write down a review. It will have a maximum word count of 200 words. Tutors can report such reviews that are ingenuine or considered to be spam. Once the team has reviewed the reported reviews, the best idea would be to give deduction points to users. New users will start off with 5 points and tutors will be asked to rate users and review them as well. Users will be reviewed as well because it can be easier to separate genuine and ingenuine users. Users with lower points will be given a few warnings until it has reached their limit. The same applies to tutors and once these users have received rating points that are too low, they will be banned from using the application. The lowest rating users and tutors can have is 3 out of 5. Once users have reached below that rating, their accounts will be removed and they will be notified. In case they attempt to create new accounts, there will be a database containing personal information of banned users to ensure that if users use try to use similar names or information, the application can cross check and banned their attempts to create new accounts. </p>
								<p> To create the application, different programs would be use to create different functions in the app. However, Java will be mainly used to create the Android version, whilst Swift is the main choice to create the iOS version. To ensure it works, some of the group members should have different laptops that uses Windows or Macintosh operating systems. Although Java is cross-platform programming language, using it on Windows is more suitable because the applications being created is to be used with Android. Other tools required is having different phones with iOS or Android implemented. Not every group member has to be familiar with both Java and Swift, because it is better for different members to have their own preference to work with. By having different specializations, the work and responsibilities can be separated for different members. For example, Edmund, Jamarl and I are more familiar with Java hence we would be responsible with creating the Android version. With access to these tools, we can test the applications using our own smartphones during alpha testing. Furthermore, we also plan to integrate credit card or Paypal payment system only. This would require us to find and partner with specialising mobile payment companies such as Braintree or Stripe and integration with Paypal company. Moreover, Google Firebase or Apple Push notifications programs would also be used to send push notifications to both parties such as reminders.  </p>
